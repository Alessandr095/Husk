This the website for Husk. A contemporary fine dining restaurant in Surrey.
The purpose of the website is to catch the eye of a potential customer, with bold high quality photos of our food, interior design and cocktails. The design behind the website is simplicity, eye-catching and easily navigable. The aim of the website is to showcase our work, give brief information about Husk and to make a reservation with ease.

## Target Audience.

As Husk is a casual fine dining restaurant, the target audience is quite vast, anyone who anyone who appreciates food and the finer details in haute cuisine is the target audience. Pricing is on the higher side but not to deter any potential guest from experiencing Husk, the price point is set to the standards we live by such as sustainable produce. Husk is not to be dined at daily or weekly, it is an experience. Our customers are here for celebrations, anniversary or just simply to enjoy a world class dining experience.

## User Stories.

The website will update with time as the menu changes seasonally, but the core of the website will stay the same and returning user and first time user will benefit from the ease of navigation nad infomation.

### As a couple looking for a restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

The site is fluid to work with, easy and to the point from the first page of brief explanation into what Husk is about, to the menu page to see the current seasonal menu on display, with the gallery page showcasing the current dishes that you will recieve to the booking button or reservation tab to easily making a reservation.

- All colours and shades throughout the website are harmonious, with a deep earthy tone, from the plates in the images of the dishes to the hero images are each page, all linked giving a sense of consistency.

- A serif font has been used throughout as it give is a more upclass feel to the website, with clean spacing.

### Colour Palette.

The colour palette I went with was a variation of whites and blacks, so that all the other elements are accentuated, such as the logo, images and menu structure.

### Typography.

![Husk](assets/images/fonts.webp)

I used Noto Serif, because of it's readability, and that it does not get lost on a white background, for its application for a fine dining restaurant, it is a classy, classic font.

### Problems.

![Husk](assets/images/test.webp)

I have an issue with my branch diverting while updating my readme file, I could not get around the problem of my readme edits not changing on GitHub so I uploaded the edited file straight to GitHub and that is when the problem occurred. I eventually fixed in by myself, but had to go through a few hoops, that is why there are multiple “test” commits, I was trying to fix the problem, which I eventually did fix.
